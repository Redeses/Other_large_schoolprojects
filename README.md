# Original Limsamaatti 2020

Project consisting of 2 parts. Express.js server that has MongoDB nosql database attached and JavaScript React.js framework frontend. Much like the current Limsamaatti project it was started to solve the problem of digitizing the sale of soda for Cluster Ry. 

As a note this is kept here to provide myself a perspective point on my development and as an example of mondoDB database usage
